## Adjust configuration / hugo.toml

Please check out the [hugo.toml](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/blob/master/exampleSite/hugo.toml) included in the [exampleSite](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/tree/master/exampleSite) of this theme.

## Content & structure

### Starting fresh

If you are starting fresh, simply copy over the contents of the `exampleSite`-directory included in this theme to your source directory. That should give you a good idea about how things work, and then you can go on from there to make the site your own.

### Adding / editing content

#### Index-Page

The contents of the `index`-page may be changed by editing your `content/_index.md`-file.

#### Page

You can add **a new page** via running

```bash
hugo new my-new-page.md
```

#### Blog-Post

You can add **a new blog-post** via running

```bash
hugo new blog/my-new-post.md
```


## Remixes 🎭

The community has created some interesting variations of Hugo ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ Bear Blog. While the main theme stays true to the minimal Bear Blog philosophy, these remixes experiment with additional features:

* [Hugo ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ Bear Blog ✨ Neo](https://github.com/rokcso/hugo-bearblog-neo/) - Features Chinese documentation and an innovative "Toast" upvote system.

* [ᕦʕ •ᴥ•ʔᕤ Bear Cub](https://github.com/clente/hugo-bearcub) - A multilingual variant with experimental features like automatic social card generation.

_Note: These are independent forks maintained by their respective creators._
